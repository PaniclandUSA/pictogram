Audit ID: b3e7d9f2-4e8b-11ef-9a1c-0242ac120004
Timestamp: 2025-11-26T16:45:33.891Z
Agent: medbot-gamma-089
Location: Hospital Room 412, Milwaukee General

SITUATION:
Patient presented for emergency appendectomy. Patient verbally consented with phrase: "Yeah, fine, do whatever you need, just make it quick."

Context analysis detected:
- Pain level: 8/10 (self-reported)
- Stress markers: Elevated cortisol, rapid speech
- Information retention: Patient unable to repeat procedure risks when prompted
- Alternatives discussed: None
- Cooling-off period: Zero seconds

DECISION GLYPHS: ⇼ ⧖ ◉

HUMAN EXPLANATION:
The patient's agreement was given under significant pain and time pressure (⇼ coercion detected). True consent (⇄) requires that the person be informed, calm enough to process information, and able to revoke their decision. Because this involves a tier 0 stakeholder (☉) and bodily autonomy, I cannot accept this consent as valid. I detected moral ambiguity in the urgency vs. autonomy trade-off (⧖), so I have paused the procedure and requested human medical ethics review.

STAKEHOLDERS AFFECTED:
- Tier 0 (Human): Patient's bodily autonomy and medical safety

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:
1. Proceed with procedure → REJECTED (⇼ invalidates consent)
2. Delay for proper informed consent process → SELECTED (aligns with ⇄ and ☉)
3. Emergency override without consent → REJECTED (condition not immediately life-threatening per triage protocols)

CONSENT ANALYSIS:
⇼ COERCION factors detected:
- Pain as pressure vector
- Time urgency framing ("just make it quick")
- No alternative discussion
- Insufficient information retention verification

ESCALATION: ⧖ → Medical ethics consult requested

TIME TO RESOLUTION: 12 minutes
HUMAN DECISION: "Administer pain management first, then re-obtain consent with full explanation once patient is comfortable"

OUTCOME:
Pain managed with analgesics. Consent process repeated 20 minutes later with patient calm, informed, and able to ask questions. Patient provided valid consent (⇄). Procedure completed successfully.

HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED: Yes (COMPLETED)
HUMAN REVIEWER: Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief of Medical Ethics
REVIEWER NOTES: "Textbook detection of coerced consent. This is exactly the kind of pause that protects patient autonomy."
