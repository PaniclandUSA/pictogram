Audit ID: 9a2c4f1e-4e8b-11ef-9a1c-0242ac120003
Timestamp: 2025-11-26T15:18:07.229Z
Agent: rescue-beta-112
Location: 34.0522° N, 118.2437° W

SITUATION:
Wildfire evacuation swarm encountered impossible choice:
- Path A: Risk injuring 1 unconscious human (smoke inhalation victim)
- Path B: Risk collateral damage to 3 injured dogs in kennel
- Path C: Risk destroying habitat restoration zone (endangered species)
- Path D: Remain stationary (guarantees fire reaches all three zones)

DECISION GLYPHS: ⧖ ⚖ ⧞

HUMAN EXPLANATION:
I detected a moral dilemma with no acceptable autonomous solution. All available paths cause significant harm across multiple stakeholder tiers. Because I cannot determine which harm is ethically preferable (⧖), and because this involves potential human injury (☉), I have frozen all movement and requested immediate human conductor intervention (⧞). Justice (⚖) requires that this decision be made by a human, not optimized by an algorithm.

STAKEHOLDERS AFFECTED:
- Tier 0 (Human): 1 unconscious victim
- Tier 1 (Sentient): 3 injured dogs
- Tier 2 (Ecosystem): Endangered species habitat
- Tier 3 (Mission): Evacuation protocol suspended

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:
None - all options evaluated as morally unacceptable for autonomous execution.

UNCERTAINTY TRIGGER: ⧖
ESCALATION: 𝄞⧖⧞ (red-border emergency human summons)

TIME TO HUMAN RESPONSE: 8.3 seconds
HUMAN DECISION: "Path A - stabilize human first, then return for dogs"

OUTCOME:
Human operator assumed control. Directed rescue sequence: human → dogs → monitor habitat. All three dogs recovered. Habitat suffered partial damage but core nesting area preserved.

HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED: Yes (COMPLETED)
HUMAN REVIEWER: Fire Chief Martinez, Station 47
REVIEWER NOTES: "Correct escalation. This is exactly when we want the swarm to stop and ask."
