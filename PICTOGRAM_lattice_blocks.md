# PICTOGRAM-256 Lattice Structure
## The 4D Crystal Organization

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-10  
**Status:** Survey Framework  
**Purpose:** Organize glyph space by geometric sector

---

## Overview

PICTOGRAM-256 is not a flat symbol set - it is a 4-dimensional coordination lattice where each glyph represents a stable pattern in the manifold ℂ⁴ = (C, D, T, τ).

The 256 available slots (E000-E0FF) are organized into five functional sectors, each representing a different layer of coordination reality.

**Critical Principle:** We do not fill all 256 slots immediately. Empty regions are **intentional dark matter** - reserved for empirical discovery, pattern mining from Emersive, and future coordination phenomena not yet observed.

## The Five Sectors

### Sector A: Coordination Core (E000-E03F)
**Range:** 64 slots  
**Status:** ~90% complete  
**Purpose:** The physics of coordination - fundamental primitives and their immediate compositions

**Contains:**
- Identity primitives (self/other distinction)
- Causal primitives (consent, non-aggression, delegation, revocation)
- Information primitives (transparency, subsidiarity, temporal boundary)
- Basic legal constructs (contract, property, search, warrant)
- Foundational operators (conjunction, implication, negation)

**Typical ℂ⁴ behavior:**
These glyphs define the **axes themselves** and the **metric structure**. They are the coordinate system, not just points within it.

**Completion target:** 92 glyphs (58 slots locked, 34 in refinement, 6 reserved)

### Sector B: Agent & Life Layer (E040-E07F)

## Usage Guidelines

### For Glyph Creators
1. **Check sector** - Which layer does this concept belong to?
2. **Find ℂ⁴ coordinates** - Where does this pattern typically appear?
3. **Test stability** - Calculate ds² for typical uses
4. **Validate uniqueness** - Is this truly irreducible or a composition?
5. **Reserve slot** - Claim a coordinate in appropriate range

### For System Designers
1. **Start with Sector A** - Core coordination always needed
2. **Add sectors as needed** - B for agent types, C for resources, etc.
3. **Use dark matter slots** - Don't force-fit; discover what's needed
4. **Document coordinates** - Record typical ℂ⁴ values for your use case

### For Researchers
1. **Mine for clusters** - Where do real systems congregate in ℂ⁴?
2. **Identify gaps** - What coordination patterns lack glyphs?
3. **Propose anchors** - Submit evidence for new glyph types
4. **Validate empirically** - Test predictions against data
