# RFC 9XXX — PICTOGRAM  
### Universal Visual Semantic Protocol  
### Internet-Draft — Standards Track  
### November 2025

---

## 1. Introduction

PICTOGRAM is a visual semantic encoding system that expresses meaning using topologically stable glyph structures. Unlike traditional writing systems—where meaning depends on cultural convention—PICTOGRAM defines meaning through **structural invariants** that remain consistent across:

- orientation  
- reflection  
- scaling  
- drawing variation  
- rendering environment  
- cultural context  

PICTOGRAM works in tandem with **Vector-Space Esperanto (VSE)** and the **ChronoCore™ cognitive logger**, forming the three-layer **Esper Stack**:  
a semantic computer architecture composed of meaning instructions, cognitive execution, and visual storage.

## 1.1 Problem Statement

Current symbolic systems fail to achieve:

- symbol consistency  
- rotation/reflection stability  
- cultural universality  
- machine interpretability  
- semantic drift resistance  
- cryptographic verifiability  

PICTOGRAM addresses these limitations through:

- D4 dihedral normalization  
- PUA-reserved glyph identities  
- topology-first canonicalization  
- PSH-256 structural hashing  

---

## 1.2 Design Goals

PICTOGRAM aims to provide:

- Universal intelligibility  
- High semantic compression  
- Orientation/reflection invariance  
- Cultural neutrality  
- Machine-verifiable meaning  
- Archaeological longevity  
- Seamless integration with semantic models

## 1.3 Document Scope

This RFC defines:

- PICTOGRAM architecture  
- Canonical glyph set  
- Composition grammar  
- Topological canonicalization  
- PSH-256 hashing process  

This document does **not** define:

- stylistic glyph variations  
- aesthetic rendering guidelines  
- glyph extension sets beyond v1.0

## 1.4 Status of This Memo

This document is an Internet-Draft submitted for consideration as a Standards-Track RFC. It may be updated, replaced, or superseded at any time.
