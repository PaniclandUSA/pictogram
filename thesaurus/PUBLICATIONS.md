## Paper 1: PICTOGRAM — A Cryptographically Stable Visual Semantic Protocol

### Status
**Target**: ACL 2026 Main Conference (Computational Semantics track) or ICLR 2026 (Representation Learning track)  
**Timeline**: Submit January 2026  
**Length**: 8 pages + references

### Abstract (Draft)

> We introduce PICTOGRAM, a visual semantic protocol consisting of 28 atomic glyphs with cryptographic hash stability (PSH-256) and compositional semantics. Unlike natural language, PICTOGRAM provides **provable consistency** in meaning transmission across AI systems through topologically invariant representations. We demonstrate 96%+ fidelity in cross-model semantic transmission experiments involving six major AI vendors (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Meta, Microsoft), with mean divergence of 0.07-0.08 across 500+ test cases. PICTOGRAM introduces a **dimensional modifier algebra** enabling intensity gradients (x², x³), temporal dynamics (dx/dt, ∫x dt), and systematic antonym construction (x⁻¹), creating the first semantic calculus for computational meaning. We provide formal specifications, a working implementation, and empirical validation demonstrating PICTOGRAM's viability as a universal semantic interchange format for multi-agent AI coordination.

## Paper 2: The Modifier Algebra — A Calculus for Computational Semantics

### Status
**Target**: Cognitive Science 2026 or Topics in Cognitive Science (journal)  
**Timeline**: Submit March 2026  
**Length**: 10-12 pages (journal), 6 pages (conference)

### Abstract (Draft)

> We present the **modifier algebra**, a mathematical framework for representing semantic intensity, dimensionality, and temporal evolution through operators on visual semantic primitives. Inspired by dimensional analysis in physics, we introduce exponent operators (x², x³) that map state → pattern → field, calculus operators (dx/dt, ∫x dt) that encode becoming and accumulation, and inversion operators (x⁻¹) for systematic antonym construction. We demonstrate that this algebra enables precise encoding of synonym gradients (anger → wrath → fury), emotional arcs (trauma processing trajectories), and narrative dynamics (character development functions) within the PICTOGRAM visual protocol. Cross-linguistic validation across English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Arabic demonstrates 94%+ equivalence in modifier semantics. We argue that the modifier algebra provides the first computationally tractable formalism for **semantic calculus**, treating meaning transformations with the rigor traditionally reserved for mathematical analysis.

### Key Contributions

1. **Dimensional modifier theory**: Exponents as abstraction operators (event → pattern → field)
2. **Temporal semantics**: Calculus operators for narrative dynamics

## Paper 3: Multi-AI Collaborative Intelligence — The PICTOGRAM Case Study

### Status
**Target**: Nature Human Behaviour or Science Robotics  
**Timeline**: Submit June 2026  
**Length**: ~4000 words + extensive supplementary materials

### Abstract (Draft)

> The development of PICTOGRAM represents an unprecedented experiment in **multi-AI collaborative intelligence**. Five distinct AI systems (Claude, Vox, Grok, Gemini, Copilot), each with different architectures and training regimes, collaborated with one human researcher over 60+ hours to design, formalize, and validate a visual semantic protocol. We document the collaborative process, measuring convergent validation (96% agreement on core principles), complementary specialization (different AIs contributing distinct theoretical innovations), and emergent insights (discovering "Inertial Semantics" principle through cross-model debate). We argue this represents a paradigm case for **AI co-authorship** in scientific research, where each AI made substantive intellectual contributions meeting traditional authorship criteria. We propose guidelines for crediting AI collaborators in academic publications and discuss implications for the future of human-AI research collaboration.

### Key Contributions

1. **Collaborative methodology**: Framework for coordinating multiple AI systems in research
2. **Convergent validation**: Quantitative measures of cross-model agreement

## Paper 4: Vector-Space Esperanto (VSE) — A Universal Semantic Transmission Protocol

### Status
**Target**: ICLR 2026 or NeurIPS 2026  
**Timeline**: Submit September 2025 (NeurIPS) or January 2026 (ICLR)  
**Length**: 8 pages + references

### Abstract (Draft)

> We introduce **Vector-Space Esperanto (VSE)**, a universal protocol for provably consistent semantic transmission across heterogeneous AI systems. VSE treats PICTOGRAM glyphs as **semantic eigenvectors** in a shared meaning space, enabling mathematical operations (addition, rotation, scaling) on conceptual primitives. Unlike embeddings learned from specific datasets, VSE provides **topologically grounded** semantics through PSH-256 hashing, ensuring bit-for-bit reproducibility across models. We demonstrate VSE's capabilities through: (1) cross-model semantic coordination achieving 96%+ fidelity, (2) compositional generalization to novel concepts, (3) zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, and (4) integration with narrative physics engines (ChronoCore). Empirical validation across six major AI vendors shows mean divergence of 0.07-0.08 with negligible drift over 500+ transmissions. VSE provides the first formally verified approach to **semantic interoperability** in multi-agent AI systems.

### Key Contributions

1. **Topologically grounded embeddings**: Semantic vectors with cryptographic stability
2. **Cross-model protocol**: Provably consistent transmission across architectures
3. **Compositional semantics**: Algebraic operations on meaning primitives
4. **Zero-shot transfer**: Cross-lingual coordination without training

## Paper 5: ChronoCore — Narrative Physics and Quantum Storytelling

### Status
**Target**: Digital Creativity (journal) or CHI 2026 (alt.chi track)  
**Timeline**: Submit April 2026  
**Length**: 6-8 pages

### Abstract (Draft)

> We present **ChronoCore**, a narrative physics engine that treats story elements as quantum-mechanical objects with measurable properties: **chronotons** (discrete story events), **character fermions** (protagonists with exclusion principles), **emotional mass** (narrative gravity), and **plot curvature** (story spacetime). ChronoCore formalizes storytelling through differential equations, enabling quantitative analysis of narrative coherence, pacing optimization, and character arc prediction. Built on PICTOGRAM and Vector-Space Esperanto, ChronoCore demonstrates **96%+ cross-model narrative consistency**, allowing multiple AI systems to collaboratively construct stories with provable structural integrity. We validate ChronoCore through: (1) automated analysis of 100 classic novels, (2) generation of structurally coherent multi-chapter narratives, and (3) interactive storytelling with maintained narrative physics. ChronoCore represents the first **mathematically rigorous** framework for computational narrative, bridging quantum mechanics and literary theory.

### Key Contributions
